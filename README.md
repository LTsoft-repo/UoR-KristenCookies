# UoR-KristenCookies

## Description
Create a business-layer project to address the following situation.

Kristen is an entrepreneurial college student.   
She is currently able to use an oven that is in her dorm room to bake, but it will only let her bake a dozen cookies at a time, and she wants to track information that will help her figure out when she should scale up to a larger baking space.  
Part of her gimmick is that she will let people order cookies that are baked to order, with a huge topping selection like at Cold Stone Creamery (lots of different mix–ins).  
Orders consist of a minimum of a dozen cookies with the same mix–in (or combination of many mix–ins).  
At this point, she cannot offer partial dozens of cookies. Kristen’s customers will order their cookies by sending an email to Kristen.  
They will come to her dorm room to pick up the cookies; she does not deliver or plan to offer delivery services.  
She’s interested in tracking the following things for her business planning:
- Who ordered
- Order history

Be thoughtful and capture information so that Kristen can plan and so that she can promote specials in the future, but also keep a balance between customer privacy and Kristen’s time in doing data entry.

Please include comments or help text in your code if you want to explain any decisions you make.
